Welcome to the Joyner Document Format official LaTeX class.
This class was written and tested using a default MacTeX installation,
so it should work out of the box
as long as you’re running an up-to-date LaTeX distribution.

## Quick start

You can clone this repo and try typesetting `jdf-starter.tex`
with the following commands:

    biber jdf-starter
    pdflatex jdf-starter

The result should look like `jdf-starter.pdf`.
* `biber` command generates used referenes from `references.bib` 
* `pdflatex` command generates the final pdf
